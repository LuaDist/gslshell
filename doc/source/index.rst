Welcome to GSL shell documentation
##################################

GSL shell is an interactive command line interface that gives easy access
to the GNU Scientific Library (GSL) collection of mathematical methods for
numerical computations.

GSL shell can be used interactively to perform calculations with matrices or
vectors but it does allow also to write complex user defined functions with
the LUA scripting interpreter.

LUA is a very interesting and easy to learn scripting language that features
advanced functionalities like closures and metamethods. LUA is very
easy to learn and will give you the power of defining your own complex routines
to use the GSL routines more effectively.

GSL Shell is hosted at `Savannah <http://savannah.nongnu.org>`_, here is the `project page <https://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/gsl-shell/>`_.

You can download the first developer preview release of GSL Shell in the `download page <https://savannah.nongnu.org/files/?group=gsl-shell>`_. You will find the source code, a binary package that require GSL 1.12 and readline5 and a DEBIAN package for ubuntu.

GSL Shell is currently developed by Francesco Abbate. You can contact him at the followng address:
