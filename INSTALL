
GSL shell is still in early developement and it is released for the
people interested in its development.

** BUILD INSTRUCTION

To build GSL shell you need LUA 5.1.4 with the LNUM patch. Both of
them are free software and can be found at the following URLs:

- http://www.lua.org
- http://luaforge.net/projects/lnum/

Further, the LNUM patch should be configured to use 'double' for
floating point numbers (this is the default behaviour) and to use
complex numbers.

In order to simplify the build process of 'GSL shell' we provide LUA
5.1.4 with the LNUM patch already configured in the distribution of
the source code.

So, in order to build GSL shell, you should do :
- edit the file makeconfig
  - use BUILD_LUA_DLL if you want only a shared library to load in Lua
  - use ENABLE_COMPLEX if you want support for complex number
    (recommended)
- in the GSL shell root folder type 'make' to build everything

In order to customize the build options you can edit the files
Makefile and makeconfig in the GSL shell root directory.

** LIBRARIES DEPENDENCIES

GSL shell does depend on GSL, of course, and it is known to work with
GSL 1.11 and GSL 1.12.

LUA 5.1 is required. We currently use LUA 5.1.4 with the LNUM patch for complex
numbers.
